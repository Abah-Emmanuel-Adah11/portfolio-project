# Build your portfolio project (Week 1): Making Progress
## Project Title: Maze project

## 1. Challenges

* What challenges have you discovered about your project that were not 
  obvious when you did your research?

  Performance Optimization:Implementing raycasting in a 3D environment
  can be computationally intensive. Moreso, ensuring its smooth performance on a variety of
  hardware configurations requires optimization techniques such 
  as efficient algorithms, data structures, and parallel processing. This really potends a
  challenge that we must find ways to overcome.

* How have you had to change your plan to adapt to these unearthed
  challenges?

  To overcome this challenge we have planned for an iterative development process which focuses on
  profiling and optimizing code regularly. Also, we consider employing efficient algorithms and data
  structures specifically tailored to the raycasting implementation. Finally, regular testing on various
  hardware configurations is also crucial to identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

* Describe any unexpected non-technical challenges?

  One major unexpected non-technical challenge we have encountered is adhering to copyright laws, licensing
  agreements, and other ethical considerations in game development. Avoiding potential legal issues and ensuring
  the game aligns with ethical standards is an unexpected non-technical challenge.

## 2. Collaboration/Communication

*  Discuss the challenges and/or success your team has had with collaborating

   One major challenge we have had to contend with as a team is, balancing workloads and
   allocating time and other resources effectively.

## 3. Project Updates

*  Outline any changes you are making to your portfolio project’s
   deliverables. Provide reasoning for each

   With respect to changes made to the project deliverables, there is no adjustment to the project
   delieverable as at the moment of this write-up.


## 4. Progress (advanced)

*   On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the progress
    you’ve made this week ?

    On a scale of 1 to 10, we will rate our progress at 7/10 for the week

*   How are you measuring your progress ?

    Progress is usually measured by virture of the magnitude of Tasks that are successfully completed

*   Discuss why you have given your team (or yourself) this rating.

    As caputured ealier the rating is based on the mangnitude of Tasks that have been successfully
    completed.

*   Provide an assessment of whether your project will be completed
    on time as specified in your Project Proposal and MVP definition.

    For now we will be optimistic that factors such as the complexity of the project, unforeseen challenges,
    team collaboration, and resource availability will not in any way impact the project timeline as specified
    in the Project proposal and MVP definiton.
